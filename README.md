## About My Project

The main purpose of developing the online crime reporting system is for the welfare and safety of the public. Due to some factors in today’s time public sometimes do not trust the government officials, due to this they don’t ever want to go the station and file a report. So this system will reconstruct the bridge between the two - public and government officials respectively

There are two kinds of admin part
1. Super Admin
2. Admin

<h5> Activitice of Upser Admin<h5> 
- In this module, Super admin will assign police-officer to their representative police station with proper data

- If any case is pending for long time then super admin can send a Notification. Super Admin also can control the whole server
- Super Admin can easily manage a full system system
- Super Admin can <a href="http://ecrime.azadhosen.com/viewComplain" target="_blank">see</a> all FIR from victim user & send status about therir FIR
